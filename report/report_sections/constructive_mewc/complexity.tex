\subsection{Complexity}

    Let be a graph $G = (V,E)$, such that $n = =|V|$ and $m = |E|$, we can now calculate the complexity of our algorithm. The cost of attributing a value to a variable should always be $\mathcal{O}(1)$. The cost of generating a matrice adjacent of the graph should always be $\mathcal{O}(1)$, this is due to the efficient implementation of our classes to get it.

    The worst complexity of our algorithm is when we study a complete graph. This means that all vertices have the maximum number of neighbors possible.
