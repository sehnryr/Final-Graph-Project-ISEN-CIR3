\subsection{Complexity}

    Let be a graph $G = (V,E)$, such that $n = =|V|$ and $m = |E|$, we can now calculate the complexity of our algorithm. The cost of attributing a value to a variable should always be $\mathcal{O}(1)$. The cost of getting an adjacency matrix of the graph should always be $\mathcal{O}(1)$, this is due to the efficient implementation of our classes to get it.
    \\ \\ 
    The complexity of the weight calculation is $\mathbb{O}(n^2)$, because we need to iterate two times over the vertices of the clique to get every edge and by extension their cumulative weight.
    \\ \\
    The worst complexity of our algorithm is when we study a complete graph. This means that all vertices have the maximum number of neighbors possible. 
    \\ \\
    This means that the function constructiveMEWCRecursive will callback $\mathbb{O}(n)$ times. In these callbacks, we call the getBestVertex function which will iterate on all the elements of Z ($\mathbb{O}(n)$ because the graph is complete). To check if the elements of Z is member of P, we use the.
