\subsection{How it works}

    To explain how our algorithm works, we will keep track of two groups of vertices : $S$ which is a partially constructed clique and the partial solution that we will gradually implement. Moreover, we also have $Z$ which is the list of all the vertices sorted according to a criterion (the best degree). Furthermore, we got $P$  which is the candidates vertices that could be included in the clique, and which represents the union of all vertex neighbors of the vertices in $S$.
    \\ \\
    The algorithm begins by forming a list of all the vertices sorted according to a criterion (the best degree). This is to facilitate the identification of the next vertices that we will add to our solution $S$. This makes it easier to identify the next vertices to be added to our solution $S$, it also saves complexity because we are not bound to check each criterion at each iteration. Then the algorithm will initialize $P$, and insert in it all the vertices of the graph.
    \\ \\
    It will then retrieve the first element of the list $Z$ that also belongs to $P$, and add it to the solution $S$. The selected element will then be removed from $Z$. After this step, $P$ is updated by considering only the neighbors of the vertices that are already part of $S$. This process is then repeated recursively until no more vertices are left in $P$, at which point the algorithm has obtained its maximum clique $S$.
    \\ \\
    To illustrate the Constructive algorithm, let's use the example in
    Figure \ref{fig:basic-graph-example} on page \pageref{fig:basic-graph-example} while adding some weight to its edges: \\

            In step 2, the algorithm will repeat the process of step 1 by making a recursive call until $P$ is empty. We can note in the process that our algorithm iterates again on some elements of $Z$, deleting them and refactoring the list does not improve the complexity, but implementing it as we did improve it in general(by not checking every neighbors each times).
