\subsection{Analysis}

In figure \ref{fig:exact_time}, we can observe the exponential increase in the
execution time of the exact algorithm with the number of vertices for different
percentages of connectivity. Note that the upper bound appears as a straight
line because of the logarithmic scale but is equal to $n^2\sqrt[3]{3}^n$. The
lower bound is matching the 0\% connectivity with a constant factor of
2.9 $\pm$ 0.09\%.
