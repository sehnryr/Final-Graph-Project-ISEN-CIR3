\subsection{How it works}

As said before, our algorithm first uses the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to obtain
all the maximal cliques of the input graph. Then, it iterates through those maximal
cliques to looks for which cliques have the highest weight. \newline

\textbf{The Bron-Kerbosch pivot algorithm} that we use is a more efficient variant
of the initial algorithm. The basic form of the algorithm is inefficient in the
case of graphs with many non-maximal cliques as it makes a recursive call for
every clique, maximal or not. To save time and allow the algorithm to backtrack
more quickly in branches of the search that contain no maximal cliques, Bron and
Kerbosch introduced a variant of the algorithm involving a "pivot vertex". \newline

At each step, the algorithm keeps track of three groups of vertices: $R$ which is
a partially constructed (non-maximal) clique, $P$ which is the candidates vertices
that could be included in the clique and $X$ which is the excluded vertices that
already have been searched (because doing so would lead to a clique that has
already been found). The algorithm tries adding the candidate vertices one by one
to the partial clique, making a recursive call for each one. After trying each of
these vertices, it moves it to the set of vertices that should not be added again.
At each recursion, $P$ and $X$ are restricted to the neighbors of current vertex
being added to $R$ and when $P$ and $X$ are both empty there are no further
elements that can be added to $R$, $R$ is a maximal clique and the algorithm
reports $R$. \newline

The recursion is initiated by setting $R$ and $X$ to be the empty set and $P$ to
be the vertex set of the graph. Within each recursive call, the algorithm considers
the vertices $P$ in turn; if there are no such vertices, it either reports $R$ as
a maximal clique if $X$ is also empty, or continue. Then, a pivot vertex $u$ is
chosen from $P\cup X$ since any maximal clique must include either $u$ or one of
its non-neighbors, for otherwise the clique could be augmented by adding $u$ to it.
Only $u$ and its non-neighbors needs to be tested as the choices for the vertex
$v$ that is added to $R$ in each recursive call to the algorithm. For each vertex
$v$ chosen from $P\backslash N(u)$, with $N(u)$ being the neighbor set of $u$,
it makes a recursive call in which $v$ is added to $R$ and in which $P$ and $X$
are restricted to $N(v)$, which finds and reports all cliques extensions of $R$
that contains $v$. Then, it moves $v$ from $P$ to $X$ to exclude it from consideration
in future cliques and continues with the next vertex in $P\backslash N(u)$. \newline

To illustrate the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, let's use the example in
Figure \ref{fig:basic-graph-example} on page \pageref{fig:basic-graph-example}:
