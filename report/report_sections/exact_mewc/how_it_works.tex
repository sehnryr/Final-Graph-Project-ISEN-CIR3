\subsection{How it works}

As said before, our algorithm first uses the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to obtain
all the maximal cliques of the input graph. Then, it iterate through those maximal
cliques to looks for which cliques have the highest weight. \newline

\textbf{The Bron-Kerbosch pivot algorithm} that we use is a more efficient variant
of the initial algorithm. The basic form of the algorithm is inefficient in the
case of graphs with many non-maximal cliques as it makes a recursive call for
every clique, maximal or not. To save time and allow the algorithm to backtrack
more quickly in branches of the search that contain no maximal cliques, Bron and
Kerbosch introduced a variant of the algorithm involving a "pivot vertex". \newline

At each step, the algorithm keeps track of three groups of vertices: $R$ which is
which is the subset of vertices that must be in a clique, $P$ which is the candidates
that could be included in the clique and $X$ which is the excluded vertices that
already have been searched. In each call of the algorithm, $P$ and $X$ are disjoint
sets whose union consists of vertices that form cliques when added to $R$.
When $P$ and $X$ are both empty there are no further elements that can be added
to $R$, so $R$ is a maximal clique and the algorithm outputs $R$. \newline

The recursion is initiated by setting $R$ and $X$ to be the empty set and $P$ to
be the vertex set of the graph. Within each recursive call, the algorithm considers
the vertices $P$ in turn; if there a no such vertices, it either reports $R$ as
a maximal clique if $X$ is also empty, or continue. Then, a pivot vertex $u$ is
chosen from $P\cup X$ since any maximal clique must include either $u$ or one of
its non-neighbors, for otherwise the clique could be augmented by adding $u$ to it.
Only $u$ and its non-neighbors needs to be tested as the choices for the vertex
$v$ that is added to $R$ in each recusive call to the algorithm. For each vertex
$v$ chosen from $P\backslash N(u)$, with $N(u)$ being the neighbor set of $u$,
it makes a recursive call in which $v$ is added to $R$ and in which $P$ and $X$
are restriced to $N(v)$, which finds and reports all cliques extensions of $R$
that contains $v$. Then, it moves $v$ from $P$ to $X$ to exclude it from consideration
in future cliques and continues with the next vertex in $P\backslash N(u)$. \newline

To illustrate the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, let's use the example in
Figure \ref{fig:basic-graph-example} on page \pageref{fig:basic-graph-example}:

        At the initial step, as said before, we will initialize $R$ and $X$ to be the
        empty set and $P$ to be the set of vertices of the graph.

    \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
        In the first call of the function, since $P$ is not empty, we chose a
        pivot vertex $u$ in $P\cup X$. As it would be more time consuming to
        search for an appropriate pivot vertex, we simply chose the first one
        available, which will be represented in \textcolor{red}{red}. In this 
        example we will always take the first element of $P$. The neighboring
        vertices of $u$ are represented in \textcolor{Cerulean}{blue}. \newline

        After that, we will iterate over the vertices of $P\backslash N(u)$,
        or in this case, $\{1,3,4,6\}$, and for each vertex $v$ we will make a
        recursive call to the function with $v$ added to $R$ and $P$ and $X$
        restricted to $N(v)$, which will find and report all cliques extensions
        of $R$ that contains $v$. \newline

    The algorithm begins by looking at vertex 2 in the graph. It makes a recursive call with using vertex 2 as a starting point. In this recursive call, the algorithm looks at the first group of vertices it was given (vertices 1 and 5) and selects one of them as the pivot vertex. Let's say it selects vertex 1. It then makes a first second-level recursive call for vertex 5. That will eventually find the clique $(1,2,5)$.
\end{minipage}
The recursive call process like this  :
$$ \boxed{

    The algorithm then makes a second second-level recursive calls for vertex 3. That will eventually find the clique $(2,3)$. After these two second level recursive calls have completed, vertex 2 is added to X and removed from P.
\end{minipage}
The recursive call process like this  :
$$ \boxed{
        \begin{array}{lll}
            R = \{2\}   & P = \{1,3,5\}     & X = \{\}  \\

    it will now do an iteration taking 4 as vertices. We note that the vertex 2 belongs to the set X in the outer call to the algorithm, but it is not a neighbor of the vertex 4 and is excluded from the subset of X passed to the recursive call. The algorithm makes a first second-level recursive call for vertex 3. That will eventually find the clique (3, 4).

    It will now do a third and final iteration taking 6 as vertex. It makes a recursive call but because $P$ is empty and $X$ is nom empty (the vertex $4$ was added to X and removed from P in step 3). Because of that, the algorithm immediately stops searching for cliques and backtracks, because there can be no maximal clique that includes the  vertex 6 and excludes the vertex 4.
\end{minipage}
The recursive call process like this  :
$$ \boxed{
        \begin{array}{lll}

    }$$
\\
The algorithm is therefore \textbf{finished}, and we have obtained the cliques :
$$\{(2,3),(1,2,5),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6)\}$$

To summarize things and try to make things even clearer, we will take another example and make the call tree of it (the precedent example is too big) :

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        1 \arrow[rr, dash] \arrow[dr, dash] & & 3 \arrow[rr, dash] \arrow[dl, dash] & & 4 \\

                    }};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

After getting every clique, the exact algorithm will iterate all maximal clique and apply a function that will return the total weight of it.
\\ \\
This function work by iterating every possible pairs of vertices in the clique and the weight of it if there is an edge between them in a variable that start at 0. The variable will be returned as the total weight of the clique.
\\ \\
Some quick example of it :
\\ \\
\hspace*{1cm}  \textbf{Step 1 :}

\begin{center}
    Total Weight $= 0$ (start)
\end{center}

\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        & \color{red} 1 \arrow[dl, dash, red, "3"] \arrow[dr, dash, "4"] \\
        \color{red} 2 \arrow[rr, dash, "1"] & & 3
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
    The function will take the vertex $1$ and $2$, the edge between them have a weight of $3$. It will add 3 in the variable "Total Weight".
\end{minipage}
\begin{center}
    Total Weight $= 0 + 3 = 3$
\end{center}

\hspace*{1cm}  \textbf{Step 2 :}
\\
\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        & 1 \arrow[dl, dash, "3"] \arrow[dr, dash, "4"] \\
        \color{red} 2 \arrow[rr, dash, "1", red] & & \color{red} 3
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
    The function will take the vertex $2$ and $3$, the edge between them have a weight of $1$. It will add 1 in the variable "Total Weight".
\end{minipage}
\begin{center}
    Total Weight $= 3 + 1 = 4$
\end{center}

\hspace*{1cm}  \textbf{Step 3 :}
\\
\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        & \color{red} 1 \arrow[dl, dash, "3"] \arrow[dr, dash, red, "4"] \\
        2 \arrow[rr, dash, "1"] & & \color{red} 3
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
    The function will take the vertex $1$ and $3$, the edge between them have a weight of $4$. It will add 4 in the variable "Total Weight".
\end{minipage}
\begin{center}
    Total Weight $= 4 + 4 = 8$
\end{center}

The total weight of this clique is 8.
\\ \\
The algorithm then takes the clique with the greatest weight. And \textbf{the MEWC is solved}.
