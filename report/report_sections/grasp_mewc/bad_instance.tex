% ----- Bad Instance -----

\subsection{Bad Instance}

The \textbf{Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures} (GRASP) algorithm is a
\textbf{meta-heuristic} search technique that has been developed to address
difficult combinatorial optimization problems. As a heuristic algorithm, GRASP
can have a lot of bad instances where it will not be able to find a good solution.
Those instances are the same as the ones for the Local Search algorithm.
\bigskip

One way the algorithm can better handle bad instances is by using its randomized
nature. The algorithm can be run multiple times and the best solution found can
be returned. This will increase the probability of finding a good solution.
