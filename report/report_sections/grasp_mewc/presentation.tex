\subsection{Presentation}

The \textbf{Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures} (GRASP) algorithm is a 
\textbf{meta-heuristic} search technique that has been developed to address 
difficult combinatorial optimization problems. \textbf{GRASP} incorporates 
restart procedures, controlled randomization, efficient data structures, and 
preprocessing to obtain good solutions to challenging problems. The algorithm 
works by incrementally constructing solutions using greedy randomization.

At each step, the algorithm chooses the next vertex of the clique using a greedy 
randomized heuristic. The heuristic is used to decide which vertex should be 
added to the current clique in order to maximize the total weight of the clique. 
The algorithm also incorporates a local search procedure to refine the solutions 
produced. This local search procedure is used to find cliques with higher 
weights than those generated by the greedy randomized heuristic. GRASP has been 
tested on a variety of graph types and has been shown to produce good solutions 
in a relatively short amount of time. Additionally, the algorithm can be easily 
modified to work for other graph optimization problems.

This algorithm uses the previously described Local Search algorithm to refine
the solutions produced by the greedy randomized heuristic.
