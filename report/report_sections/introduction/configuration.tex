For this project we used \textbf{C++} to develop and implement our algorithms. 
It is a general-purpose programming language that has been used for a long time 
and is still widely used today. It is a compiled language, which means that it 
is translated into machine code before being executed. This allows it to be very 
fast and efficient. It is also a statically typed language, which means that the 
type of each variable must be declared before it is used. This allows the compiler 
to check the type of each variable and to detect errors at compile time. \newline

Though C++ is a very powerful language, it is also very complex and has a lot of
features. This can make it difficult to use. That's why we had a debate about
which language to use for this project. Our choices were C++ and Python. We
eventually chose C++ because it is a language that we are all familiar with and
that we have all used before. We also chose it because it is a very powerful
language that allows us to implement very efficient algorithms. \newline

To be able to work on the project efficiently and to be able to share the code
between us, we used \textbf{Github}\footnotemark 
\footnotetext{\url{https://github.com/sehnryr/Final-Graph-Project-ISEN-CIR3}}.
It is a web-based platform for version control, collaboration, and sharing of
code, as well as a community of developers who contribute to open source projects
and share their knowledge. It was a tool that was difficult for some to get used
to quickly, especially on the configuration of the project at home, but which
brought us a significant gain in efficiency once we had understood how to use it.
And to share information and communicate between us, we used \textbf{Discord}.
