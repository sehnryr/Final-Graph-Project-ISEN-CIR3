    \subsection{Analysis}

    In figure \ref{fig:local_search_time}, we can observe the polynomial increase in the execution time of the constructive algorithm with the number of vertices for different percentages of connectivity. Note that the theoretical is matching the 75\% connectivity with a constant factor of 7.146$\times10^{-8}$.
    \bigskip
    
    As we know, the worst case of the algorithm is when the graph is complete. That is, connectivity is at its maximum (100\%). As we can see, increasing the connectivity and the number of vertices of the graph has a chance to increase the complexity of the structure of that graph, which in turn increases the time complexity of the algorithm. 
    \bigskip
    
    We can notice some factors appearing according to the different number of connectivity. The algorithm takes in average 18 times more time with 75\% than with 25\% and in average 4 times more time with 50\% than with 25\%.
    \bigskip
    
    So, the local algorithm is an in-between between the constructive and the exact algorithm in terms of execution time and results obtained. We will detail this points further in the conclusion.
