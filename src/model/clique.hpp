/**
 * @brief The Clique class
 *
 * This class represents a clique in a graph. A clique is a subset of vertices
 * that are all connected to each other. It contains a unordered_set of vertices
 * for faster lookup. It also contains the weight of the clique.
 * The weight is not calculated by the class itself, but is set by the user.
